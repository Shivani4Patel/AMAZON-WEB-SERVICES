# Amazon S3: Scalable Cloud Storage

## Key Features and Concepts

### 1. Buckets and Object Storage
- **Bucket**: A container for storing objects (files, data).
- **Object Storage**: Data is stored as objects within these buckets.

### 2. Replication
- Ensures data is duplicated across different locations for redundancy and availability.

### 3. Storage Classes
- Different tiers optimized for cost and access needs:
  - **Frequent access**
  - **Infrequent access**
  - **Archive storage**

### 4. Static Website Hosting
- Host static websites directly from an S3 bucket.

### 5. Access Control List (ACL)
- Manages permissions and can transfer object ownership.

### 6. Versioning
- Maintains multiple versions of an object.
- Helps in recovering deleted objects.

### 7. Encryption
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Data is encrypted before uploading.
- **In-Flight Encryption**: Secures data during transmission using HTTPS.
- **Server-Side Encryption**: AWS encrypts stored data.

### 8. Events
- Triggers actions (like notifications) based on bucket events (e.g., object creation, deletion).

### 9. Bucket Policies
- Define rules for access and management of bucket contents.

### 10. Global Uniqueness of Bucket Names
- Bucket names must be unique across all AWS regions.

### 11. Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) with Object Lock
- Prevents objects from being modified or deleted for a set retention period.

### 12. Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
- Unique identifier for AWS resources.

### 13. Resource-Based Policies
- Define actions that can be performed on a resource and by whom.

## Properties
- Each object and bucket in S3 comes with properties like:
  - **Storage class**
  - **Metadata**
  - **Permissions**

## Use Cases
- Websites
- Mobile apps
- Enterprise applications
- Backup and restore
- Archiving data
- IoT devices
- Big data analytics

- Click **Create Bucket**.

### **2. Uploading an Object**
- Open the created **S3 Bucket**.
- Click **Upload** > **Add Files** > **Select the file**.

![Upload Object](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38c379c-8d6b-414e-a1d8-b428ac212bf3)

- Click **Upload**.

### **3. Granting Public Access via Bucket Policy**
- Go to **Bucket Permissions**.

![Bucket Permissions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63c61492-2481-4932-95a9-fb47154b0417)

- Click **Edit Bucket Policy**.
- Use the **Policy Generator**:

![Policy Generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf53242-db74-4c17-9982-dcb43a3353ba)

  - Select **S3 Bucket Policy**.
  - Set **Principal** to `*` (allows all users).
  - Copy and paste the **Object ARN**.
  - Generate and apply the policy.

### **4. Accessing the Object**
- Use the **Object URL** to check access.
- If "Access Denied" appears, verify the **Bucket Policy** and permissions.
- Once configured correctly, the object will be accessible via the public URL.
