Serverless Lambda Functions: Java Application Example
Overview
•	Purpose: Develop a Java application to be run as a serverless function using AWS Lambda.
•	Function Constraints: Maximum execution time of 15 minutes.
•	Deployment:
o	Develop and compile the Java application.
o	Compress the application files (e.g., jar file).
o	Upload to AWS Lambda.
•	Advantages:
o	No need to manage or pay for servers.
o	Costs incurred only when the function is invoked.
o	Scalable and flexible.
Workflow
1.	Development: Write and compile the Java application.
2.	Packaging: Compress the application (e.g., into a zip file containing the jar).
3.	Upload: Deploy the compressed file to AWS Lambda.
4.	Invocation:
o	The Lambda function can be triggered by events, such as file uploads to S3.
o	Can also be invoked via APIs.

Managing Invocations
Synchronous vs Asynchronous Invocation
•	Synchronous:
o	The client waits for the response from the Lambda function.
o	Useful when the client needs an immediate response.
•	Asynchronous:
o	The client invokes the function and continues without waiting for the response.
o	Useful for background tasks or when immediate feedback isn't required.
