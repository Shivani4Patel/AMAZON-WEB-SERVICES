## AWS Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool Setup

This Project provides a step-by-step process to create and configure an AWS Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool for user authentication and authorization. The process includes setting up a federated login with Google, enabling MFA, defining IAM roles, and configuring a client application for authentication.

* 1. User Pool Setup 

- Step 1: Create a User Pool

  Navigate to the AWS Cognito service. Select Add user to directory and create a User Pool.

- Step 2: Configure Federated Sign-In with Google.Choose Federated Provider as the authentication method.Select Google as the sign-in option.

- Step 3: Configure Security Policies

  Keep the default password policy settings.Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).Set Automatic Verification and Account Confirmation to streamline user 
  onboarding.

- Step 4: Assign IAM Role

  Assign an IAM role for Cognito, either selecting a default role or providing a custom role.

- Step 5: Finalize User Pool Setup

  Provide a User Pool Name.Configure the Client Application settings, including the callback URL.Complete the creation of the User Pool.

- Step 6: Testing User Authentication

  Access the sign-up page generated by Cognito.Register a new user and verify via email.After successful email verification, log in with the registered   
  credentials.Once authenticated, the user will be redirected to the specified local host page.

* 2. Identity Pool Setup

- Step 1: Create an Identity Pool

  Navigate to the Cognito Identity Pools section in AWS. Click Create Identity Pool.

- Step 2: Link to the User Pool

  Provide the User Pool ID and App Client ID from the previously created User Pool.Enable authentication through the configured federated provider (Google).

- Step 3: Assign IAM Roles

  Assign IAM roles for authenticated and unauthenticated users.Ensure the roles have the necessary permissions to interact with AWS services securely.

- Step 4: Finalize Identity Pool Setup

  Complete the setup and integrate it with your application for authentication and authorization.

This setup allows users to authenticate using Google Sign-In via AWS Cognito and gain authorized access to AWS resources through an Identity Pool. The integration ensures secure user authentication with features like MFA and automatic verification.
